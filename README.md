#Star War Movies

##A Star Wars Movie site, that shows information about the 6 movies.

You can view this at https://stormy-thicket-77727.herokuapp.com/

##Synopsis
This website  uses Express (a node.js framework) to show different 
star wars movies,their description, and starring actors. There is a home page which presents all the movie posters
and also has a navigation bar with a dropdown menu of the different movies. It uses express to render different movie 
templates when the user either clicks on a poster icon on the screen or an icon name from the navigation bar. I DID NOT
make the styles.css file, or the movies.json, that was provided by Ryan Hemrick. 


##How to Run it on Local Computer

1. Download Node.js and the Express framework
2. Then simply run `node app.js` in the root directory (where you cloned the project)
