# Star-Wars-Movies
A basic Star Wars movie app


This website is uses Express (a node.js framework) to show different 
star wars movies and their descriptions. There is a home page which presents all the movie posters
and also has a navigation bar with a dropdown menu of the different movies. It uses express to render different movie 
templates when the user either clicks on a poster icon on the screen or an icon name from the navigation bar. I DID NOT
make the styles.css file, or the movies.json, that was provided by Ryan Hemrick.
